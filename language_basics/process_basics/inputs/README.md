### Input Block

The input block follows the syntax shown below:

input:
  <input qualifier> <input name>

#### Types of Input Qualifier:

* `val`: Lets you access the received input value by its name as a variable in the process script.
* `env`: Lets you use the input value to set an environment variable named as the specified input name.
* `path`: Lets you handle the received value as a file, staging the file properly in the execution context.
* `stdin`: Lets you forward the received value to the process stdin special file.
* `tuple`: Lets you handle a group of input values having one of the above qualifiers.
* `each`: Lets you execute the process for each entry in the input collection.

1. `val`:

    Lets you access the received input value by its name as a variable in the process script.

    example: 

            - refer process_input_val.nf
            - run `nextflow process_input_val.nf -process.echo` 

2. `path`:

    Lets you handle the received value as a file, staging the file properly in the execution context.

    example: 

            - refer process_input_path.nf
            - run `nextflow process_input_path.nf -process.echo` 

#### Now let's try combining the different inputs together

A key feature of processes is the ability to handle inputs from multiple channels. However itâ€™s important to understand how the number of items within the multiple channels affect the execution of a process.

    example:

        - refer process_combine_inputs.nf

3. `each`: Lets you execute the process for each entry in the input collection.

    We saw previously that by default the number of times a process runs is defined by the queue channel with the fewest items. However, the each qualifier allows you to repeat the execution of a process for each item in a list or a queue channel, every time new data is received.

    example:

        - refer process_repeat.nf
    
    What is the application of `each` practically?

    when we want to generate index for our file with different kmers

    example:

        - refer process_each_use_case.nf
