### What is workflow

We can connect processes to create our pipeline inside a workflow scope. The workflow scope starts with the keyword workflow, followed by an optional name and finally the workflow body delimited by curly brackets {}.

Note: <A workflow definition which does not declare any name is assumed to be the main workflow, and it is implicitly executed. Therefore itâ€™s the entry point of the workflow application.>
